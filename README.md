### Was it easy to complete the task using AI?
The construction of the Controllers, Services, and Test was fully developed by ChatGPT, I mostly only had to place the code properly.

### How long did the task take you to complete? 
Around an hour.

### Was the code ready to run after generation? What did you have to change to make it usable?
Most of the code provided by ChatGPT this time was not runnable since it does not know how the API internally works, and there needs to be proper modification of the code for it to work accordingly.

### Which challenges did you face during completion of the task?
I struggled mostly in the API, since it requires an API Key that is not free for everyone to access.

### Which specific prompts you learned as a good practice to complete the task?
I learned that you can ask ChatGPT to use an alternative solution other than the one it origianlly offered, for example I used this prompt:
`\use an alternative other than step verifier`
